## Bag Dreams with GANs in PyTorch

In the final week of this quarter, I worked to try interacting with and making generative adversarial neural nets (GANs).

### Acquiring data

Typical student and professional neural net projects seem to rely on massive, clean, labeled datasets that can practically not be created without a large amount of time or funding. To subvert this model for projects and make something slightly more unique, I worked to create a GAN with data I could find online.

The first stage of work on my project consisted of finding and downloading a stockpile of images in my area of interest. I'm interested in bags and have been [making bags](https://heavycreambags.com/) for a couple years, so I was curious to try to create a network that could also "design" bags.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/popuguy/Bag-Dreams/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
